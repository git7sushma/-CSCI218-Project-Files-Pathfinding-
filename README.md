# -CSCI218-Project-Files-Pathfinding-

# This is our Group Project on Intelligent PathFinding Using the two most Effiecent Algorithmns 
#Dijkstra 
#A Star 

In this project you will be able to set your start and end goals, place obstacles 
User can run either of the Algorithmns and then comparsion of times taken to finishign pathfinding will be shown . 
we have also implemented moving obstacles which was an optional task as a challenge and it seems to work very well. the moving obstacles are detected and path is reconsidered and found!! 


#  HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM 

1. Install Pygame:
    pip install pygame

2. Open project folder in VS Code:
    File → Open Folder → Select this folder

3. Run the program: (finalll.py)
    - Click "Run" in VS Code
    OR
    - Use terminal: python main.py   (py finalll.py)

----------------------- CONTROLS -------------------------
Left Click  = Place Start, End, or Obstacles  
Right Click = Remove cell  
M + Click   = Create moving obstacle  
D           = Run Dijkstra  
A           = Run A*  
SPACE       = Compare both  
C           = Clear grid
